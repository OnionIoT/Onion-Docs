## Shell Scripting {#shell-scripting}

A shell script in simply a script that excutes a series of commands written in the script at once from the terminal. This is equivalent to any programming language where you can execute a script from a console. 

Linux can come with two types of shells, the C shell and the and Bourne Shell. Since we are using OpenWRT we are only concerned with the latter, which we invoke when we type `sh` into the command line. At this point, we will write a simple script and explain what will happen at each step during execution. This script uses some general programming techniques. So if you are new to programming, we recommend reading [this](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix/unix-what-is-shell.htm) for an in depth explanation.

Take a look at this example script below, we'll be working with it soon:

```
# Anything after the hash symbol is considered a comment.
# This script will create log of the time the script that was executed
# and the name of the person who executed it. The log will be stored in
# a file called log.txt, found in the "/" directory. The script will 
# also display the contents of the log.txt file on the terminal. 
#The line below tells Linux which shell to use for execution

#!/bin/bash 

# Create NAME variable with value name
NAME=name 

# Create DATE variable with value date
DATE=date 

#Prompt User to input their name
echo -n "Please Enter Your Name >"

#Store the value entered by the user into the variable username
read username

#Store the value of our username in NAME variable
NAME=$username

#The DATE stores the value returned by the date command. in form $(command)
DATE=$(date)

#Append the NAME and DATE values to the log.txt file
echo $NAME $DATE >> /log.txt 

#Display the contents of the log.txt file
cat /log.txt
```

Copy the script to the "/" folder in your Omega and save it as LogGen.sh. Run the script by entering this script into terminal and see what happens. 

```
sh LogGen.sh
```

Run it a few times entering different names and see what happens in the output. 

It should look something like this.

The last topic of the Linux Introduction Series introduces the concept of [Users, Ownerships and Permission in Linux systems](#ownership-and-permissions).
