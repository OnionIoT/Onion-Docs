## Registering on the Onion Cloud
// Need a nice intro on what the cloud provides (interacting with Omegas using rest apis), the concept of cloud devices, and why we need to register our device on the cloud


### Register using the Console




### Register Manually

// see the following as a guideline: https://wiki.onion.io/Documentation/Cloud/Steup-Omega-for-the-Onion-Cloud#method-2-setup-using-the-command-line

// outline steps required to manually register your device on the Cloud (include a photo for each step)
1. log on to cloud.onion.io and go to the Device Manager App - photo should show Cloud interface
2. Create a new device - photo should have an arrow to the add device button
3. Name the device - photo showing how a name is given
4. Click on the newly created device to get to the detailed view, Generate a setup code and copy it - photo pointing to the setup code button on the topbar, another with the generated code window showing
5. On the omega, run the `onion-cloud setup <setup code>` - include screencap of terminal
