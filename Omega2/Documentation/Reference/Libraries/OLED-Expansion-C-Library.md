## OLED Expansion C Library {#oled-expansion-c-library}

The Onion OLED Expansion library, `libonionoledexp` is a dynamic C library that provides functions to setup and perform various actions on the OLED display: writing text, displaying images, and adjusting various settings.

![Omega+OLED Expansion](http://i.imgur.com/tqcRlgG.jpg)

The library can be used in C and C++ programs.

This library is also available as a [module for use in Python](./OLED-Expansion-Python-Module). The module is called `oledExp` and is part of the `OmegaExpansion` package.






<!-- Programming Flow -->

### Programming Flow

After each power-cycle, the chip that controls the OLED Expansion must be programmed with an initialization sequence to setup the display and enable it to receive additional commands.

After the initialization, the other functions can be used to ajdust various screen settings or display text or images.


#### Understanding the Display

The screen has a resolution of 128x64 pixels. It is addressable by 128 vertical columns and 8 horizontal pages:

![Page and column visual](http://i.imgur.com/4JsaahS.png)

Each page consists of 8 horizontal pixel rows. When a byte is written to the display, the Least Significant Byte (LSB) corresponds to the top-most pixel of the page in the current column. The Most Significant Byte (MSB) corresponds to the bottom-most pixel of the page in the current column.

![Page detail](http://i.imgur.com/8DIiN2n.png)

So writing `0x0f` would produce the top 4 pixels being coloured in, and the bottom 4 being left blank.

<!-- LAZAR: add more examples and an image showing the examples -->

The display keeps a cursor pointer in memory that indicates the current page and column being addressed. The cursor will automatically be incremented after each byte is written, the cursor can also be moved by the user through functions discussed below.



<!-- MAJOR HEADING -->
<!-- The C Library -->

### The C Library

The `libonionoledexp` C library is a series of functions that perform all of the actions specified in the [Programming Flow section](#Programming-Flow).


<!-- Source Code -->

#### Source Code

The source code can be found in the [Onion `i2c-exp-driver` GitHub Repo](https://github.com/OnionIoT/i2c-exp-driver).


<!-- Using the C Library -->

#### Using the C Library

**Header File**

To add the Onion OLED Expansion Library to your program, include the header file in your code:
``` c
#include <oled-exp.h>
```

**Library for Linker**

In your project's makefile, you will need to add the following dynamic libraries to the linker command:
``` c
-loniondebug -lonioni2c -lonionoledexp
```

The dynamic libraries are stored in `/usr/lib` on the Omega.



<!-- Using the C Library: Example Code -->

#### Example Code

The Onion OLED Expansion C library is used in the implementation of [the `oled-exp` command line tool.](../../Tutorials/Expansions/Using-the-OLED-Expansion#using-the-oled-expansion).

The source code can be found [here](https://github.com/OnionIoT/i2c-exp-driver/blob/master/src/main-oled-exp.c), on the `i2c-exp-driver` Onion GitHub Repo.



<!-- Return Values -->

#### Return Values

All functions follow the same pattern with return values:

If the function operation is successful, the return value will be `EXIT_SUCCESS` which is a macro defined as `0` in `cstdlib.h.`

If the function operation is not successful, the function will return `EXIT_FAILURE` which is defined as `1`.

A few reasons why the function might not be successful:
* The specified device address cannot be found on the I2C bus (the Expansion is not plugged in)
* The system I2C interface is currently in use elsewhere

An error message will be printed that will give more information on the reason behind the failure.



<!-- Init Function -->

#### Initialization Function

This function programs the initialization sequence on the OLED Expansion, after this step is completed, the other various OLED functions can be used with success:
``` c
int	oledDriverInit ();
```


**Examples**

Initialize the OLED Expansion:
``` c
int status 	= oledDriverInit();
```



<!-- SUB-HEADING -->
<!-- Settings Functions -->

#### Functions to Adjust Settings

There is a series of functions that adjust various settings on the OLED Display. The adjustable settings are:
* Screen on/off
* Colour inversion
* Setting screen brightness
* Setting the memory mode
* Defining the width of each page
* Setting the cursor position


<!-- Screen on/off -->

##### Turn the Screen On and Off

The screen can be turned on and off while still preserving the displayed contents:

``` c
int oledSetDisplayPower	(int bPowerOn);
```

Note: turning on a screen that is already on, or turning off a screen that is already off will have no effect.

**Arguments**

The `bPowerOn` argument is detemines whether to turn the display on or off

| Value   | Meaning                   |
|---------|---------------------------|
| 0       | Turn the screen **off**   |
| 1       | Turn the screen **on**    |


**Examples**

Turn the screen off:
``` c
int status;
status = oledSetDisplayPower(0);
```

Turn the screen on:
``` c
status = oledSetDisplayPower(1);
```


<!-- Invert Display Colours -->

##### Invert Display Colours

The screen driver has the ability to invert the display colours, meaning that black becomes white and vice versa:

``` c
int oledSetDisplayMode (int bInvert);
```

**Arguments**

The `bInvert` argument is detemines whether to invert the colours or not

| Value   | Meaning                   |
|---------|---------------------------|
| 0       | Normal colour settings    |
| 1       | Inverted colour settings  |

**Examples**

Invert the colours:
``` c
int status;
status = oledSetDisplayMode(1);
```

Return the colours to normal:
``` c
status = oledSetDisplayMode(0);
```


<!-- Set Brightness -->

##### Set the Display Brightness

The brightness of the display can be adjusted in a granularity of 256 steps:

``` c
int oledSetBrightness (int brightness);
```

The default brightness after initialization is 207.

**Arguments**

The `brightness` argument is detemines the display brightness with a range of **0 to 255**, with 255 being the brightest setting and 0 being the dimmest.


**Examples**

Set to maximum brightness:
``` c
int status;
status = oledSetBrightness(255);
```

Set to lowest possible brightness:
``` c
status = oledSetBrightness(0);
```

Set to middle brightness:
``` c
status = oledSetBrightness(127);
```


<!-- Dim the display -->

##### Dim the display

This function implements a 'dim' and a 'normal' setting for the display:

``` c
int oledSetDim (int dim);
```

While the brightness adjustment function described just above implements the same feature, this function simplifies the procedure with two very disctinct settings.


**Arguments**

The `dim` argument is detemines whether to enable the dim setting

| Value   | Meaning                         |
|---------|---------------------------------|
| 0       | Normal brightness: 207          |
| 1       | Dimmed screen: 0                |

**Examples**

Dim the display:
``` c
int status;
status = oledSetDim(1);
```

Set the display to normal brightness:
``` c
status = oledSetDim(0);
```


<!-- Set the memory mode -->

##### Set Memory Mode

Implements the ability to select the display's memory mode:

``` c
int oledSetMemoryMode (int mode);
```

The memory mode affects how the cursor is automatically advanced when the display memory is written to with text or images.


**Horizontal Addressing Mode**

![Horizontal Addressing](http://i.imgur.com/sU0WyZY.png)

After each write, the column cursor advances horizontally to the right along the page, once the end of the page is reached, the page cursor is advanced onto the next page.


**Vertical Addressing Mode**

![Vertical Addressing](http://i.imgur.com/Dv1smND.png)

After each write, the page cursor advances vertically downward through the pages, once the last page is reached, the column cursor is advanced to the next pixel column


**Page Addressing Mode**

![Page Addressing](http://i.imgur.com/oW4giq6.png)

The column cursor advances horizontally to the right along each page, once the end of the page is reached, the column cursor wraps around to column 0 and the page cursor remains the same.

By default, **Horizontal Addressing** is used.


**Arguments**

The `mode` argument detemines which memory mode is active, it is recommended to use the `eOledExpMemoryMode` enumerated type:

| Memory Mode                | Input                               |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Horizontal Addressing Mode | `OLED_EXP_MEM_HORIZONTAL_ADDR_MODE` |
| Vertical Addressing Mode   | `OLED_EXP_MEM_VERTICAL_ADDR_MODE`   |
| Page Addressing Mode       | `OLED_EXP_MEM_PAGE_ADDR_MODE`       |

**Examples**

Set to page addressing mode:
``` c
int status;
status = oledSetMemoryMode(OLED_EXP_MEM_PAGE_ADDR_MODE);
```


<!-- Set Column Addressing -->

##### Set Column Addressing

This function is used to define where each page starts and ends horizontally:

``` c
int oledSetColumnAddressing (int startPixel, int endPixel);
```

Changing the start and end pixels changes the width of each page. By default, the column addressing is set from 0 to pixel 127. This means that each page has 128 usable columns, once the cursor reaches the last column, the display knows this page is filled.

For example, when writing text, the `oledWrite` function will set the columns to run from 0 to 125 in order for the characters to display properly. Since each character is 6 columns, 21 full characters can be displayed on a single line, the end pixel is set to 125 so that the 22nd character gets placed on the next line instead.

Note: the column cursor is not preserved after a column addressing change.

**Arguments**

The `startPixel` argument sets the starting column for each page.

The `endPixel` argument sets the end column for each page.

Both arguments must be between **0 and 127** and startPixel must be **less than** endPixel.


**Examples**

Set the column addressing to display text:
``` c
int status;
status = oledSetColumnAddressing(0, OLED_EXP_CHAR_COLUMN_PIXELS-1);
```

Set the column addressing to the full display width
``` c
status = oledSetColumnAddressing(0, OLED_EXP_WIDTH-1);
```

Set each column to start halfway across and to end three quarters of the way across the display:
``` c
status = oledSetColumnAddressing(63, 95);
```


<!-- Set Column Addressing: Text Columns -->

###### Set Columns for Text

A function exists to define the column addressing specifically for text:

``` c
int oledSetTextColumns ();
```

It sets the start pixel to 0 and the end pixel to 125. This allows for 21 text characters per line. This function should be run before setting the cursor for writing text.


<!-- Set Column Addressing: Image Columns -->

###### Set Columns for Images

Also, a function exists to define the column addressing to cover the entire screen:

``` c
int oledSetImageColumns ();
```

It sets the start pixel to 0 and the end pixel to 127. This enables the use of the entire screen real estate.





<!-- Set Cursor Position -->

##### Set Cursor Position

Any data written to the screen gets written to the current position of the cursor. This position can be adjusted.

Two methods exist:
* Specifying the page row and character column
* Specifying the page row and pixel column


<!-- Set Cursor Position: By Character Column -->

###### Set Cursor Position by Character Column

This function is used to position the cursor on a specific page and character column. After this call, the next bytes written to the screen will be displayed at the new position of the cursor:

``` c
int oledSetCursor (int row, int column);
```

Note: since the column cursor is not preserved after a column addressing change, the column addressing **needs be set to 0-125 using the `oledSetTextColumns()` function to properly display text before the cursor position is programmed.**


**Arguments**

The `row` argument sets the page for the cursor, so the range is **0 to 7**

The `column` argument sets the character column position of the cursor, the range is **0 to 20**


**Examples**

Set the cursor to the start of the last page:
``` c
int status;
status = oledSetCursor(7, 0);
```

Set the cursor to the middle of the 4th row:
``` c
status = oledSetCursor(3, 10);
```

Set the cursor to the starting position at the top-left
``` c
status = oledSetCursor(0, 0);
```

Write 'hello' at the top left of the screen, and then write 'hi there' on the middle of the 7th row:
``` c
status 	= oledSetCursor(0, 0);
status	|= oledWrite("hello");
status 	|= oledSetCursor(6, 10);
status	|= oledWrite("hi there");
```

<!-- Set Cursor Position: By Pixel -->

###### Set Cursor Position by Pixel

This function is used to position the cursor on a specific page and pixel row. This gives more fine grain control than setting by character column.

After this call, the next bytes written to the screen will be displayed at the new position of the cursor:

``` c
int oledSetCursorByPixel (int row, int pixel);
```

It allows for cursor positions that are not aligned with the 21 possible character columns.


**Arguments**

The `row` argument sets the page for the cursor, so the range is **0 to 7**

The `pixel` argument sets the horizontal pixel position of the cursor, the range is **0 to 127**


**Examples**

Set the cursor to the start of the last page:
``` c
int status;
status = oledSetCursorByPixel(7, 0);
```

Set the cursor to the middle of the 4th row:
``` c
status = oledSetCursorByPixel(3, 63);
```

Set the cursor to the bottom-left
``` c
status = oledSetCursorByPixel(7, 0);
```

Write 'hello' at the top left of the screen, and then write 'hi there' on the middle of the 7th row:
``` c
status 	= oledSetCursorByPixel(0, 0);
status	|= oledWrite("hello");
status 	|= oledSetCursorByPixel(6, 63);
status	|= oledWrite("hi there");
```


<!-- Clearing Function -->

#### Clear the Screen

To clear the screen and move the cursor to the starting position at the top-left of the screen:

``` c
int oledClear ();
```


<!-- SUB-HEADING -->
<!-- Writing Text -->

#### Writing Text to the Display

Listed below are the functions that write bytes, characters, strings, or images to the display.


<!-- Write Byte -->

##### Write a Single Byte

Write a single byte, eight vertical pixels, to the current position of the cursor:

``` c
int oledWriteByte (int byte);
```

**Arguments**

The `byte` argument holds the eight bits that will be written to the screen. The Least Significant Bit (LSB) in the byte corresponds to the top-most pixel in the column, the Most Significant Bit (MSB) corresponds to the bottom-most pixel in the column.

![Page detail](http://i.imgur.com/8DIiN2n.png)

After the byte is set, the cursor will automatically move to the next page column.


**Examples**

Draw the following pattern:

![Page detail](http://i.imgur.com/lxs1q8J.png)

``` c
int status;
status =  oledWriteByte(0x01);		// 0x01 = 0b 0000 0001
status |= oledWriteByte(0x03);		// 0x03 = 0b 0000 0011
status |= oledWriteByte(0x07);		// 0x07 = 0b 0000 0111
status |= oledWriteByte(0x0f);		// 0x0f = 0b 0000 1111
status |= oledWriteByte(0x3f);		// 0x3f = 0b 0011 1111

```

<!-- Write Character -->

##### Write a Single Character

Write a single character to the current position of the cursor:

``` c
int oledWriteChar (char c);
```

**Arguments**

The `c` argument is the character that is to be written to the screen.

Make sure to check the `asciiTable` dynamic array found in `oled-exp.h`, it defines the bitmap pattern of each allowed character. Any characters not found in the table will be ignored.


**Examples**

Write an 'O'
``` c
int status;
status = oledWriteChar('O');
```

Write an open bracket, an x, then a close bracket:
``` c
status =  oledWriteChar('(');
status |= oledWriteChar('x');
status |= oledWriteChar(')');
```


<!-- Write String -->

##### Write a String

Write an entire string of characters, starting at the current position of the cursor:

``` c
int oledWrite (char *msg);
```

Underneath, this uses the `oledWriteChar` function to display characters and also implements newline functionality.

The newline functionality is implemented by using a global variable to keep track where the cursor is in each row (I know... shameful...). Once the characters '\' and 'n' are detected, the `oledWrite` function will print spaces to the display until it reaches the end of the current page and the cursor increments its position to the next page.

Note: the column addressing will be set to 0-125 to properly display text during this call, at the end of the function it will be reset back to 0-127.


**Arguments**

The `msg` argument is the string to be written to the display. Any characters not found in the `asciiTable` array will be ignored.


**Examples**

Write 'Onion Omega':
``` c
int status;
status = oledWrite("Onion Omega");
```

Write 'Onion Omega', then 'Inventing the Future' on the next line, and then 'Today' two lines below:
``` c
status =  oledWrite("Onion Omega\nInventing the Future\n\nToday");
```



<!-- SUB-HEADING -->
<!-- Displaying Images -->

#### Drawing Images on the Display

The OLED Screen can also be used to display images. The Console can be used to convert existing images into a format that is compatible with the OLED Expansion and save the output to an Omega. Functions in the C library can read the image data and display it on the OLED Expansion. Alternatively, a buffer can be created programatically and displayed on the OLED.


<!-- Displaying Images: Creating Image Files -->

##### Creating Image Files

The Console OLED App can be used to create OLED Expansion compatible image files. Navigate to the Image tab of the OLED App:

![OLED Console App Image Tab](http://i.imgur.com/FPCVp8x.png)

Once an image has been selected, a button and form will appear that allow you to save the OLED image file to your Omega:

![OLED Console App Loaded Image](http://i.imgur.com/xKx5KHa.png)

After the image name and location are selected, click the Save to Omega button.


<!-- Displaying Images: OLED Image File Details -->

##### OLED Image File Details

The OLED image files store the image data as 1024 bytes represented in hexadecimal. Each byte represents eight vertical pixels, with the first 128 bytes representing the columns in Page 0, the following 128 bytes representing the columns in Page 1, and so on.

If this is unclear, see the [Understanding the Display Section](#programming-flow_understanding-the-display) for details on how the display is addressed.


<!-- Displaying Images: Displaying Images from a File -->

##### Displaying Images from a File

###### Read Image Data

First, the data from the file needs to be loaded into a buffer:
``` c
int oledReadLcdFile	(char* file, uint8_t *buffer);
```

**Arguments**

The `file` argument is the path to the OLED image file.

The `buffer` argument is a pointer to the memory that will hold the image data. It needs to be able to hold 1024 bytes (1 byte for each column in a page).

###### Write Image Data to the Display

Then, write the data from the buffer to the display:
``` c
int oledDraw (uint8_t *buffer, int bytes);
```

**Arguments**

The `buffer` argument is the pointer to memory that holds the image data.

The `bytes` is the number of bytes to be written. This will usually be 1024 bytes, this can be represented with macros: `OLED_EXP_WIDTH*OLED_EXP_HEIGHT/8`.


**Example**

Read an image file located at `/root/image.lcd` and draw it on the OLED display:
``` c
int status;
uint8_t	*buffer = malloc(OLED_EXP_WIDTH*OLED_EXP_HEIGHT/8 * sizeof *buffer); // allocate memory for the buffer

// read data from file
status 	= oledReadLcdFile(param, buffer);

// draw on display
if (status == EXIT_SUCCESS) {
	status	= oledDraw(buffer, OLED_EXP_WIDTH*OLED_EXP_HEIGHT/8);
}
```


It is also possible to programmatically fill a buffer and then draw it on the OLED display:
``` c
int i, status;
uint8_t data;
uint8_t	*buffer = malloc(OLED_EXP_WIDTH*OLED_EXP_HEIGHT/8 * sizeof *buffer); // allocate memory for the buffer

// programatically fill the buffer
data = 0;
for (i = 0; i < OLED_EXP_WIDTH*OLED_EXP_HEIGHT/8; i++) {
	buffer[i] = data;

	// increment the data for the next column
	if (data == 0xff) {
		data = 0;	// reset to 0
	}
	else {
		data++;		// increment by 1
	}
}

// draw on display
status	= oledDraw(buffer, OLED_EXP_WIDTH*OLED_EXP_HEIGHT/8);
```




<!-- SUB-HEADING -->
<!-- Scrolling the Display -->

#### Scrolling the Display Contents

The OLED can scroll the contents of the screen horizontally or upwards at a 45 degree angle. The displayed content will wrap around when it reaches the edge of the display.



<!-- Horizontal scrolling -->

##### Horizontal Scrolling

Scroll all or part of the screen horizontally:

``` c
int oledScroll 	(int direction, int scrollSpeed, int startPage, int stopPage);
```

**Arguments**

The `direction` argument indicates whether to scroll to the left or right:

| `direction` Value | Scrolling Direction |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| 0                 | Left                |
| 1                 | Right               |

The `scrollSpeed` argument determines the number of "frames" between each scroll step, it is recommended to use the `eOledExpScrollSpeed` enumerated type:
* OLED_EXP_SCROLL_SPEED_5_FRAMES
* OLED_EXP_SCROLL_SPEED_64_FRAMES
* OLED_EXP_SCROLL_SPEED_128_FRAMES
* OLED_EXP_SCROLL_SPEED_256_FRAMES
* OLED_EXP_SCROLL_SPEED_3_FRAMES
* OLED_EXP_SCROLL_SPEED_4_FRAMES
* OLED_EXP_SCROLL_SPEED_25_FRAMES
* OLED_EXP_SCROLL_SPEED_2_FRAMES

The `startPage` argument defines at which page to start scrolling, and `stopPage` defines at which page to start the scroll. The range for both is **0 to 7**, and startPage must be less than stopPage.


**Examples**

<!-- LAZAR: Add gifs to all examples -->

Scroll the entire screen to the left:
``` c
int status;
status = oledScroll (0, OLED_EXP_SCROLL_SPEED_5_FRAMES, 0, OLED_EXP_CHAR_ROWS-1);
```

![left scroll](http://i.imgur.com/nytY4Xw.gif)

Slowly scroll pages 1 to 5:
``` c
int status;
status = oledScroll (1, OLED_EXP_SCROLL_SPEED_25_FRAMES, 1, 5);
```


<!-- Diagonal scrolling -->

##### Diagonal Scrolling

Scroll all or part of the screen diagonally upwards:

``` c
int oledScrollDiagonal 	(int direction, int scrollSpeed, int fixedRows, int scrollRows, int verticalOffset, int startPage, int stopPage);
```

**Arguments**

The `direction` argument indicates whether to scroll upwards to the left or right:

| `direction` Value | Scrolling Direction |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| 0                 | Upwards and Left    |
| 1                 | Upwards and Right   |

The `scrollSpeed` argument determines the number of "frames" between each scroll step, it is recommended to use the `eOledExpScrollSpeed` enumerated type:
* OLED_EXP_SCROLL_SPEED_5_FRAMES
* OLED_EXP_SCROLL_SPEED_64_FRAMES
* OLED_EXP_SCROLL_SPEED_128_FRAMES
* OLED_EXP_SCROLL_SPEED_256_FRAMES
* OLED_EXP_SCROLL_SPEED_3_FRAMES
* OLED_EXP_SCROLL_SPEED_4_FRAMES
* OLED_EXP_SCROLL_SPEED_25_FRAMES
* OLED_EXP_SCROLL_SPEED_2_FRAMES

The `fixedRows` argument defines the amount of pixel rows, starting from the top, **will not** have vertical scrolling. The range is **0 to 63**.

The `scrollRows` argument defines the amount of pixel rows, starting from the top, that **will** have vertical scrolling.

The `verticalOffset` argument defines the number of vertical rows to scroll by each frame.

The `startPage` argument defines at which page to start scrolling, and `stopPage` defines at which page to start the scroll. The range for both is **0 to 7**, and startPage must be **less than** stopPage.


**Examples**

<!-- LAZAR: Add gifs to all examples -->

Scroll the entire screen upwards to the left:

```


<!-- Stop scrolling -->

##### Stop Scrolling

Disables all active scrolling:

``` c
int oledScrollStop ();
```

**Examples**

Scroll the entire screen to the left, then stop it:
``` c
int status;
status = oledScroll (0, OLED_EXP_SCROLL_SPEED_5_FRAMES, 0, OLED_EXP_CHAR_ROWS-1);
status |= oledScrollStop ();
```
