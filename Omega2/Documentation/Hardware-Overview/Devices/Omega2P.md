### MicroSD Card Slot

The MircoSD card slot can be used to expand the Omega2+'s storage capacity to ridiculous levels. If 32MiB was a problem for you, you can now hit it with a tactical warhead. To help you get started, there's a guide on [using a MicroSD card](#using-a-microsd-card).

The slot can be found at the bottom of the Omega2+. To physically mount a MicroSD card, slide it into the slot, push it down until it clicks. If it pops all the way back up, just do it again, and it should stay.
