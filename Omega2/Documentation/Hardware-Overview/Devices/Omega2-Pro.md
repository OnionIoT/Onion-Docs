## Onion Omega2 Pro {#omega2-pro}

The Omega2 Pro is the next generation of our Omega2 and the most powerful IoT computer we’ve made yet. It is a standalone device – the processor, memory, gigabytes of storage, and Wi-Fi are all built-in, and it’s smaller than a breadboard.

### The Expansion Header

The Expansion Header is a convenient tool that gives you easy access to the Omega's GPIOs, and allows you to connect Onion Expansions directly. The Expansion Header is labelled to show you what GPIO is connected to each section.

> Take a look at the [Using the GPIOs](https://docs.onion.io/omega2-docs/using-gpios.html#important-special-gpios) article to learn more about the Omega's GPIOs, multiplexing GPIO functionality, and the behaviour and requirements of the Omega's special GPIOs.

### LiPo Battery Support

An on-board battery management chip makes the Omega2 Pro compatible with LiPo batteries: they can be used as the main power source, and will be charged when the Omega is connected to USB power. Use a battery to make your project portable, or to act as a back-up power supply.

### Full-color Notification LED

Along with the system status and Wi-Fi status LEDs, there is a full-color LED (WS2812) driven by a hardware pulse width modulation (PWM) controller.

### Node-Red

Node-RED is a flow-based, visual programming tool that runs in the browser. It comes packaged as an OnionOS App on the Omega2 Pro and can be easily accessed through OnionOS in any browser.


Learn more about installing and using Node-Red on the Omega2 Pro by following [this guide](#node-red-article).
