## Bluetooth Low-Energy Expansion

// overview of the Bluetooth Low-Energy Expansion, it's BLE 4.0, usb connection, allows the Omega to communicate with bluetooth devices

The Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE) Expansion is a USB-based expansion that adds Bluetooth 4.1 connectivity to your Omega allowing it to interact with other Bluetooth-enabled devices. You can plug it into the USB port on an Onion Dock and use it to create cool bluetooth projects!

### The Hardware

// Overview of the hardware:
//  - the white part is the antenna, circuitry and an LED is enclosed
//  - usb connector

// not much to this one, just plug it in

The white plastic casing houses the antenna, circuitry and an LED indicator. The other part of the Expansion is the USB connector that allows you to plug in the dongle into your Docks.

#### Connecting to a Dock

// plugged into the USB Port
// have photos of it plugged into the Exp dock, power dock, minidock, and arduino dock 2

#### LED

// LED will be solid when the antenna is in use, it might flash, this needs to be tested

The LED will be solid blue when the antenna is in use.



### Using the Bluetooth Expansion

// give an example of when connecting to bluetooth devices would be useful

Most wireless audio systems prefer to use Bluetooth over WiFi because Bluetooth is a much more stable connection over short ranges. This is why this Expansion is the perfect tool to transform your Omega into a wireless audio controller.

You can check out our [guide to using the Bluetooth Expansion](#using-bluetooth-expansion) for more on what you can do with this Expansion.

<!-- TODO: add link to guide to bluetooth expansion -->

// link to the using the bluetooth expansion article
//  - follow all these steps on the Omega2 to get bluetooth streaming
// note: will need some firmware support from Lazar... ask him about this

// refer to the existing article for details:
