### The U.FL Connector

Connect an external antenna to the Omega's male surface-mounted U.FL connector. An external antenna can be used to extend the range of WiFi connectivity or provide a very directional signal. When an external antenna is plugged in, the SMT and external antennas will split the transmission power, providing only half of expected gain. In order to use your external antenna at its maximum performance, you will need to modify your Omega by removing the 0 Ohm resistor that is located between the WiFi antenna and U.FL connector so all the power goes to the external U.FL antenna.

Follow the procedure outlined [here](https://onion.io/2bt-u-fl-antennas-with-the-omega/) to modify your Omega. 

**DISCLAIMER:** Perform any modifications to your device very carefully and at your own risk. This procedure is difficult to undo, and will require the permanent use of an external antenna to have any sort of reasonable WiFi connectivity. If you damage your Omega during this procedure, Onion Corporation is not responsible.
