### The U.FL Connector

Connect an external antenna to the Omega's male surface-mounted U.FL connector. An external antenna can be used to extend the range of WiFi connectivity or provide a very directional signal. If a U.FL antenna is plugged in, it will be used as the default antenna, no setup required.
