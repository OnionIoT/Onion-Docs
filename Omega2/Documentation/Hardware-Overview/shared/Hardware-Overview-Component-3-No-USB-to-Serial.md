#### No-USB-to-Serial

There is no USB-to-Serial Chip on the Breadboard Dock. This means that you will **not** be able to connect to the Omega serially over the Micro-USB port.

You can still connect to your Omega's terminal with SSH, you can learn how to do that in this [guide to connecting to the Omega](#connecting-to-the-omega-terminal-ssh).
