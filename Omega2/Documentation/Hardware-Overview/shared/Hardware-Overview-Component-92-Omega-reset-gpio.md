### Reset GPIO

The Omega's can be reset using GPIO38. When plugged into a Dock (e.g. Expansion Dock), this GPIO gives various functionality to the reset button found on docks. For example, a quick button press triggers the reboot command, whereas holding the button for about 10 seconds will trigger a factory reset command.
