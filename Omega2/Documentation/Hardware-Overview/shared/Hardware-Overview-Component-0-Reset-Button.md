### Reset button

The Reset Button on the Dock is connected directly to the Omega's Reset GPIO. Pressing this button do one of two things: reboot, or factory restore.

#### Reboot

Momentarily pressing the reset button and letting go will initiate a reboot of the Omega OS. 

#### Factory Restore

Pressing and **holding** the reset button for **10 seconds then releasing** will trigger a factory restore.

Warning: This will reset your Omega to the default filesystem of the last firmware update, **this will delete ALL of your data!**

See the [Factory Reset documentation article](#factory-reset) for more details.
