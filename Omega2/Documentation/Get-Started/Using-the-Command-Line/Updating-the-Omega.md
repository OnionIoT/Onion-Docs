## Updating the Omega {#updating-the-omega}

In order to keep improving user experience for the Omega, we will be releasing updated firmwares on a rolling basis. To get the benefits of these improvements, users should frequently update their Omegas to the latest firmware release. We have created a command-line utility `oupgrade` (Onion Upgrade) to handle firmware transitions.

> The `oupgrade` command will **not** work properly if you run it from the Terminal App on the Console. Use `oupgrade` when connected to the Omega via SSH or Serial. If upgrading using the Console, use the [Settings App](#updating-the-omega-using-console).

### How do I know if I need to update my Omega?

>**Warning**: When an upgrade is performed, only the `/root` and `/etc` folders are preserved. It is important to backup your files on the Omega prior to upgrading if you don't want to lose any of your work.

To check if your Omega needs an upgrade, run `oupgrade -check`. The output will let you know if you need an update:
```
root@Omega-2757:/# oupgrade -c
> Device Firmware Version: 0.1.4 b210
> Checking latest version online...
> Repo Firmware Version: 0.1.5 b132
> Comparing version numbers
> New firmware version available, need to upgrade device firmware
```

The easiest thing to do is to just run `oupgrade`. This way it will check if your firmware needs updating and will perform the upgrade if necessary.

#### Versions vs. Build Numbers

Every firmware has a **version** and **build number**.

* Minor updates will be released as new build numbers for a given firmware version.
    * eg. version 0.1.4 build 100, build 103, build 110
* Major updates will be released as a new firmware version.
    * eg. version 0.1.3, version 0.1.5, version 0.1.6


### Performing the Upgrade

<!-- #### Using `oupgrade` -->

To run the `oupgrade` tool, simply enter the following in your command-line:

```
oupgrade
```

It will take care of checking for firmware updates, and automatically installing them if they are available.

By default, `oupgrade` will only install new firmware **versions**.

<!-- #### Doing More with `oupgrade`-->

### Getting your firmware version

To get the current firmware installed on the device type:

```
oupgrade -v
```

And you'll see:

```
root@Omega-2757:/# oupgrade -v
> Device Firmware Version: 0.1.5 b132
```

Here we're on version `0.1.5` and build `132` of the device firmware.


### Checking for New Firmware Versions

To check your firmware version and compare it with the latest available firmware versions type:

```
oupgrade -c
```

```
root@Omega-2757:/# oupgrade -c
> Device Firmware Version: 0.1.5 b132
> Checking latest version online...
> Repo Firmware Version: 0.1.5 b132
> Comparing version numbers
> Device firmware is up to date!
```

As you can see from the output, our firmware is up to date!

If it were not up to date, this command would show:
```
root@Omega-2757:/# oupgrade -c
> Device Firmware Version: 0.1.5 b131
> Checking latest version online...
> Repo Firmware Version: 0.1.5 b132
> Comparing version numbers
> New build of current firmware available, upgrade is optional, rerun with '-force' option to upgrade
```

or if you're on an older version:

```
root@Omega-2757:/# oupgrade -c
> Device Firmware Version: 0.1.4 b210
> Checking latest version online...
> Repo Firmware Version: 0.1.5 b132
> Comparing version numbers
> New firmware version available, need to upgrade device firmware
```

*This command only checks for the latest firmware version and will not modify your device.*


### Upgrading to the Latest Version
Here at Onion we're constantly developing, adding new features and fixing bugs. However, sometimes the features we release may cause the firmware to be unstable. Normally `oupgrade` will only upgrade to the latest **stable** version, skipping any unstable versions.

If you need to upgrade to the latest version anyway, you can type:
```
oupgrade -l
```

**Note: This is not recommended unless you know what you're doing!**

This will not reflash the Omega if the latest firmware is already installed.

### Force Update/Reflash

You can force `oupgrade` to reflash the Omega with the latest firmware using the `-f` flag. **Note: This will reinstall the firmware even if the Omega already has the latest available!**

```
oupgrade -f
```

Since this will cause the Omega to reflash itself, this can be used in case you need to safely reset to a working state on the latest firmware.

**IMPORTANT:** See the warning below about what files will be preserved and erased when upgrading the firmware.


### Help with `oupgrade`

`oupgrade` has a lot of functionality on the command line. Type

```
oupgrade -h
```

to get the usage output.

```
root@Omega-2757:/# oupgrade -h
Functionality:
  Check if new Onion firmware is available and perform upgrade

Usage: /usr/bin/oupgrade

Arguments:
 -h, --help        Print this usage prompt
 -v, --version     Just print the current firmware version
 -l, --latest      Use latest repo version (instead of stable version)
 -f, --force       Force the upgrade, regardless of versions
 -c, --check       Only compare versions, do not actually update
 -u, --ubus        Script outputs only json
```
